# VIII Conclusion and Future directions
## VIII-A Conclusion

This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of current approaches to world modeling, examining their relevance for robotic manipulation, underlying architectures, functionalities, key challenges, and proposed solutions. By synthesizing these findings, we offer insights into the nature of real world models and outline the efforts required to advance the field. Our goal is to provide readers with a solid foundation and guide future research directions in world modeling.

## VIII-B Future research directions

From our survey of current approaches and analysis of the core components and capabilities of world models, it is evident that present models fall short of accurately representing real-world phenomena. The limitations and the set of expected capabilities define promising directions for future research. To provide additional context, we also discuss several significant research directions.
