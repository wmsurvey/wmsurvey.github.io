World models play a critical role in robotic learning in two ways. They allow robots to improve autonomous policies by the internal prediction and simulation of environmental dynamics, future states, and/or action outcomes \cite{hafner2019learning,hafnerdream,hafner2021mastering,wu2023daydreamer,ebert2018robustness,guo2025flowdreamer}. They also support scalable policy training and evaluation by generating realistic rollouts and physical interactions \cite{zitkovich2023rt,black2024pi_0,team2025gemini,barcellona2025dream,lu2025gwm,liu2025rdt}. From a functional standpoint, current approaches range from single-purpose models, such as those for visual planning \cite{ebert2018robustness,finn2016unsupervised}, future-scene generation \cite{sudhakar2024controlling,barcellona2025dream,jang2025dreamgen}, or action prediction \cite{sekar2020planning}, to more integrated systems that couple multiple abilities within a unified framework \cite{cen2025worldvla,chen2025egoagent,zhen20243d,song2025physical,zhu2025irasim}.
